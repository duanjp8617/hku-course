This is the lab7 implemented with angular js. The functionality of the web page is exactly the same as last year's lab7. But I replace the front end implementation with angularJS.

The ./views folder and ./routes/index.js are deleted because we don't need pug/jade template engine any more.

The code for creating the jade/pug template engine and defining routes variable are commented out in app.js.

The static webpage file is located in /public/index.html, the script file is in /public/javascripts/externalJS.js.

To run lab7, please use the following command:

1. Set up mongodb according to last year's lab7 handout. 

2. npm start

3. go to localhost:3000 to see the web page.
