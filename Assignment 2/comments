Dear Jingpu,

I have gone through the solution of assignment 2. Attached please find files that I touched. Please check these files out and also do the following:

1. add comments into the solution files 

2. preparing CSS styling. Especially, note the following:
-remove markers from the news list
-the page numbers at the bottom of the news list display page should be underlined; instead of using “background-color: yellow” to highlight the current page index, use a different color for the font
-replace “back” on individual news entry display page by an arrow, as shown in snapshots in the assignment handout
—“login to comment” and “post comment” should be buttons

3. Prepare the detailed marking scheme 

Thanks,
Chuan
